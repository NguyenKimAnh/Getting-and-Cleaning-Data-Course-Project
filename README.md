# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This Average Data Set is created by Nguyen Kim Anh from the original data set  in  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Datas
et.zip. 

It is an  independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each of six activities (WALKING, 

WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) and each subject with subject_id from 1 

to 30.

Each pair of activity and subject corresponds to one and only one record. For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Average values of Triaxial acceleration from the total acceleration and the estimated body acceleration.
- Average values of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Average values of 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the activity

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'avr_features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the average feature vector.

- 'avr_features.txt': List of all average features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'Average data set/avr_data.txt': Average values of 561 features

- 'Average data set/avr_label.txt': activity labels for the Average data set

- 'Average data set/avr_subject.txt': id_subject for the Average data Set

- 'Average data set/avr_total_acc_x.txt': Average values of the acceleration signals from the smartphone accelerometer X axis 

in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector (128 times of reading). The same description applies for 

the 'avr_total_acc_x.txt' and 'avr_total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'Average data set/Inertial Signals/avr_body_acc_x.txt': Average values of the body accelerations signals obtained by 

subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- Average data set/Inertial Signals/avr_body_gyro_x.txt': Average values of the angular velocity vector measured by the 

gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
